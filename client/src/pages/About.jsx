                  Keratin Complex® revolutionized the beauty industry in 2007 when a group of industry innovators discovered a new way to care for your hair by merging proven keratin science with cutting-edge technology. They created Natural Keratin Smoothing Treatment, a first-of-its-kind smoothing treatment that pioneered the way to healthy, smooth, frizz-free hair and winner of the Favorite Smoothing Treatment by Behind the Chair Stylist Choice Award for 8 years in a row. Since then, we have continued to push boundaries and remain the leaders in smoothing with a full collection of customizable keratin treatments for every hair type. 

We are proud to be the #1 product line of choice for salon professionals. Over the years we’ve brought the same power of Keratin to a full line of salon-quality hair care products including a comprehensive keratin-enhanced color line. Our unique formulas are engineered with our proprietary Keratin to eliminate frizz, repair damage, strengthen, and soften for undeniably healthy hair.
